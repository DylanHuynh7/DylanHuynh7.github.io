I'm a computer engineering major at CSUF who intends to graduate by 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 4, part 1

  This lab was picked because it was my first proper exposure to coding as a whole. Prior to this class I entered with zero knowledge of coding and the labs before four involved me getting confused. During this I began to understand how the double variables worked and that small moment of understanding was very memorable.

*Lab 7, part 1

  In lab seven I found it worth being called one of my favorites because I believe it’s one where I started improving in coding. My partner for the assignment was extremely helpful and we collaborated quite well over the assignment despite neither of us being particularly strong at coding. The process of learning about writing restrictions with each other was a good growing experience for myself and enjoyable at the same time.

*Lab 12, part 1

  I had to include this lab as the final product was something I had found more interesting than the others. Creating a gif via a flip book animation style made the final lab more intriguing than the others to me. It also served as a gauge of how much I’ve improved since starting this class when I originally had no experience in coding.
